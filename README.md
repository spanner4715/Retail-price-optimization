Determining a price of product plays a crucial role to business. Assessing max profit of products by using conception of price elasticity of demand (EPD) and using OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) to implement regression  
Elasticity is the degree to which the compelling desire for something changes as its price changes. It could be applied to denote its sensitivity of sales to price fluctuations. In addition, price elasticity gives the percentage change in quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, holding everything else constant.

  Observe R-squared value & coefficient of price which are parameters for evaluating model's performance and its elasticity![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/103509243/188218228-917ad811-628b-4ff3-923c-11e57ff7ea72.png)
